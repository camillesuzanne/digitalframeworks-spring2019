# Assignment 4

### Pitch
In the wake of Attorney General William Barr’s decision last month to detain asylum seekers indefinitely, immigration at the Southern border has captured the public’s attention. But of the over 42,000 asylum cases decided in fiscal 2018, over half involved people from over 100 countries outside Central America, according to TRAC data compiled by Syracuse University. 

What impact has the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration had on immigrants’ ability to receive bond or parole? I will be focusing primarily on immigrants from countries outside of Central America, especially Muslim and other religious minorities imprisoned in detention.

### Data sources
I will be relying on Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Clearinghouse, or TRAC, for data on immigration by nationality to the United States. This database also includes data related to rates of detention, bond and apprehensions, as well as case outcomes, all of which you can filtered by nationality. 

### Data visualizations
- Chance of parole or cost of bond over time by nationality
Before Donald Trump became president, most asylum seekers who passed credible fear screenings were released on parole. But asylum seekers' chances of obtaining parole the past two years have plummeted, leaving many to languish in jail, according to a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against the Department of Homeland Security. 

- Chart of wide range of bond amounts by nationality
Bond amounts set in immigration courts have increased under the Trump administration and can reach more than $50,000, although the median bond amount awarded in immigration court last year was $7,000, according to TRAC data.

### Sources for anecdotes
I have had interviews with attorneys at the ACLU, South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT) and MacArthur Justice Foundation about this topic so far this month. I will continuing to interview organizations representing immigrants from outside Central America, and will also be reaching out to activists and immigrants on the ground involved in efforts to address issues related to detention, including Communities Organizing Against Deportation.
