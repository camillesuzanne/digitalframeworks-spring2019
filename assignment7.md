## Assignment 7: Charter school industry lobbying 

I covered the nation's first charter school strikes when I was in Chicago. In an era of increased organizing by teachers and unions against charter school networks, I wanted to dig into how much influence pro-charter school interest groups have in Washington based on lobbying reports. 

I found that the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools and the Charter Schools Action Fund, lobbied on behalf of charter schools.

### Pitch:
This year, teachers and unions have spurred an unprecedented upheaval in charter schools across the country. In the span of just three months, Chicago witnessed nearly 700 of its charter school teachers walk out on strike, with the Acero Charter School Network launching the first ever charter school strike in U.S. history last December, and the Chicago International Charter School network teachers following suit in February. Charter school interest groups backed a number of candidates in 2018 elections, but with little success, despite having Betsy DeVos in office. Are these grassroots efforts eclipsing the charter school industry's lobbying efforts?

1. Looked at 2018 lobbying reports for each group.
1. Analyzed 2018 political contributions for each group. 

### HED: Charter school lobbying groups keep up lobbying even as teachers strike across the country
### Nutgraf: 

The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools lobbying has been on the decline since it reached a record high of $440,000 in 2009. Last year, the group spent $190,000 lobbying on issues such as "charter school funding," according to lobbying reports. Success Academy Charter Schools spent $160,000 on lobbying and Breakthrough Charter Schools spent $120,000 in 2018. Charter School Management spent $100,000 last year.
