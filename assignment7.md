## Assignment 7: Charter school industry lobbying 

I covered the nation's first charter school strikes when I was in Chicago. Since then, I have wanted to investigate how much influence pro-charter school interest groups have had in Washington based on lobbying reports. 

I found that the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, the Charter Schools Action Fund and others, lobbied on behalf of charter schools. The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools' lobbying has been on the decline since it reached a record high of $440,000 in 2009. Last year, the group spent $190,000 lobbying on issues such as "charter school funding," according to lobbying reports. Success Academy Charter Schools spent $160,000 on lobbying and Breakthrough Charter Schools spent $120,000 in 2018. Charter School Management spent $100,000 last year. In contrast, the American Federation of Teachers spent some $3.6 million the two years after Trump began his presidency — a record high for the labor group with interests in promoting public school eduation. 

### Pitch: In an era of increased organizing by teachers and unions against charter school networks, how is the charter school industry holding up?
This year, teachers and unions have spurred an unprecedented upheaval in several charter school networks across the country. In the span of just three months, Chicago witnessed nearly 700 of its charter school teachers walk out on strike. Acero Charter School Network launching the first ever charter school strike in U.S. history last December, and the Chicago International Charter School network teachers following suit in February. Charter school interest groups backed a number of candidates in the 2018 elections, but with minimal success. 

Are these grassroots efforts eclipsing the charter school industry's lobbying efforts even as Education Secretary Betsy DeVos continues to support the privitization of schools?
 
### In order to find my story, I did the following:
1. I went to OpenSecrets.org
1. I searched the database for pro-charter school interest groups.
1. I found National Alliance for Public Charter Schools and the Charter Schools Action Fund — two pro-charter school interest groups making political contributions and lobbying.
1. I looked at 2018 lobbying reports for each group on the Senate and House website, looking at both the general issue area code and the specific lobbying issue. 
1. I analyzed 2018 political contributions for each interest group. 

### HED: Charter school lobbying groups holds steady as teachers strike across the country
### Nutgraf: 
In an era of increased organizing by teachers and unions against charter school networks, pro-charter school interest groups' lobbying and political contributions to promote federal charter school funding have been steady, but have not increased. The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools' lobbying has been on a slight decline since it reached a record high of $440,000 in 2009. Last year, the group spent $190,000 lobbying on issues such as "charter school funding," according to lobbying reports. Success Academy Charter Schools spent $160,000 on lobbying and Breakthrough Charter Schools spent $120,000 in 2018. Charter School Management spent $100,000 on lobbying last year. The pro-charter school interest groups give a majority of contributions to Republican candidates. In contrast, the American Federation of Teachers, with interests in promoting public school eduation under a conservative administration, spent about $3.6 million in 2016 and 2017 — a record high for the labor group. It's likely too soon to determine if the teacher strikes and more localized efforts to curb charter school growth in urban centers across the country have impacted the charter industry's influence on a federal level.
