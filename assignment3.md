1. Some cells had "n/a" or "none" when no data was entered. Others were just blank. I standardized the blank cells so all had "n/a". 
2. I separated the first name and last name. If there was no name, "anoymous"  was listed. I made sure this appeared in both the first and last name cell. I also added a third column for any names with middle initials. 
  - I did this by clicking "Text to Column." Then I clicked "Delimited." I checked “Space.” I changed both of these columns to be "Text." I then clicked "Finish." This separated the first and last names. 
3. I changed Header to First and inserted a column to the right titled "last," "first," and "middle." 
4. "The Chicago Reader" was some times listed as "Reader" and other times listed as "Chicago Reader" I standardized this so all requests were "The Chicago Reader."
