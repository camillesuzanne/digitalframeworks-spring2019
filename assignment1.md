## Are labor unions dying? 
Following the 2016 presidential election, unions witnessed a barrage of attacks on the labor sector. Most notably, the Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in Janus v. AFSCME gave public workers the choice to opt out of unions and not pay membership dues. Many labor organizers predicted the adoption of such “right-to-work” laws would be a death call for unions, which have already seen their share of workers decline over the last 35 years. Overall, union membership stayed steady and financial consequences have yet to be seen. Despite recent blows, unions have dug in and continue to wield financial influence in lobbying efforts too. But what have been the impacts of the Supreme Courts Janus ruling thus far? I will analyze recently filed financial reports from unions to track financial trends from the past year. What has the loss of agency fee payers had on unions one year since the Janus decision?

* [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/mass-exodus-of-public-union-fee-payers-after-high-court-ruling) recently did a brief analysis of the financial data from two of the largest unions: the American Federation of State and County Municipal Employees (AFSCM) and Service Employees International Union (SEIU). Both union lost a vast majority of agency fee payers (or employees who opted out of union membership and still paid union fees before the SCOTUS ruling). However, more analysis is needed to understand the impact across the unionized labor sector. This would have been a great story to add data visualization to. 



## Are corporations in violation of the WARN Act being held accountable?
The WARN Act (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act) requires that companies with over 75 full-time employees provide at least 60 days notice to workers before mass closures and layoffs. But workers often find themselves facing employers who violate the act. Late last year in Chicago, seven Treasure Island grocery stores closed and about 700 workers lost their jobs, accrued paid time off and health care benefits. They never got the severance pay that the WARN Act required. A group of workers filed a class action lawsuit, but it will be months before workers find out if they receive compensation, if any. How often are corporations in violation of the WARN Act held accountable, and how often do workers see their lost pay? I want to analyze federal WARN Act data to see how well the law is being enforced. 

* ProPublica produced a series called [Insult to Injury](https://www.propublica.org/series/workers-compensation) about workers hurt on the job and left uncompensated due to the gutting of worker benefits across the country. One article in particular in the series titled, [The demolition of workers' comp](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-demolition-of-workers-compensation)stood out to me for its compelling presentation of data. One of the data visualizations in the article an [interactive component](https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/workers-comp-reform-by-state) that readers can link to for more detail that I will critique here. The journalists were careful to provide both a title and dek to the data visualization to guide readers through complicated findings. The data presented is complex -- it shows worker compensation outcomes in each state, broken down by three categories (cuts to benefits, benefits staying the same, benefits increased). To visualize these shifts over time, the visualization assigns easily understandable colors (red represents loss, green an increase, and yellow minimal change). The data is also displayed in two different types of visualizations:
  1 The first visualization features small, color-coordinated circles, each representing a different state. The circles are organized in the shape of the United States and each circle has the state initials on it. Clicking on the state pulls up recent legislation that either cuts or adds worker compensation benefits
  1 Readers can also filter by their specific state to find this same information.
 I would give the clarity and accuracy of the visualization a 5. I think the quality is also noteworthy. The investigative journalists compiled their own system to rank each state by quality of workers compensation after going over court documents and insurance statements on their own. This information did not exist in this digestable form. The authors also decided to provide an explanation below as to how they analyzed the data. I would give quality a 5, but I will note that having the data presented in two different visualizations does present significant data that could be overwhelming for a reader. However, the fact that the team decided to link to this more in-depth interactive graphic outside the article (while still providing an abbreviated one in the article) I think solves this issue. As I mentioned above, I found the color coordination to be helpful too. I liked the subtle, gradations of the colors too. I think it conveys the intensity of the issue.
