## Are labor unions dying? 
Following the 2016 presidential election, unions witnessed a barrage of attacks on the labor sector. Most notably, the Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in Janus v. AFSCME gave public workers the choice to opt out of unions and not pay membership dues. Many labor organizers predicted the adoption of such “right-to-work” laws would be a death call for unions, which have already seen their share of workers decline over the last 35 years. Overall, union membership stayed steady and financial consequences have yet to be seen. Despite recent blows, unions have dug in and continue to wield financial influence in lobbying efforts too. But what have been the impacts of the Supreme Courts Janus ruling thus far? I will analyze recently filed financial reports from unions to track financial trends from the past year. What has the loss of agency fee payers had on unions one year since the Janus decision?

* [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/mass-exodus-of-public-union-fee-payers-after-high-court-ruling) recently did a brief analysis of the financial data from two of the largest unions: the American Federation of State and County Municipal Employees (AFSCM) and Service Employees International Union (SEIU). Both union lost a vast majority of agency fee payers (or employees who opted out of union membership and still paid union fees before the SCOTUS ruling). However, more analysis is needed to understand the impact across the unionized labor sector. This would have been a great story to add data visualization to. 

### EXAMPLE OF ARTICLE USING DATA 

[*Quartz* published a story](https://qz.com/1542019/union-membership-in-the-us-keeps-on-falling-like-almost-everywhere-else/) on the decline of union membership. Although my story will focus on the longer term financial picture of American unions, membership is still very relevant to this topic. *Quartz* provides two data visualizations to accompany this article. 

 1. The first titled, "Rate of union membership among US workers," shows the decline of union membership between 1984 (the first time this data was recorded) and 2018. The line graph is easy to read and digestable. However, I found the decision to create a y-axis with a range of 0 to 20 percent troubling. I think it likely provided a more drastic line graph, but I think exaggerates the data. At quick glance, it appears that in 1984, union membership was at 100 percent. I would therefore give **clarity and accuracy** a 2. 

 1. The second set of charts features the same concept: percentage of population in unions, but this time for six other countries. The y-axis of each of these smaller graphs is 0 to 75 percent. The graph also changes from a linear graph to a bar graph. 

The **quality** of the graphs is also not ideal. I would rate it a 3. Having a more interactive component to the graphs would have been helpful. For instance, if the reader hovers over a spot on the graph, it would have been interesting to know how many people that percentage of corresponds to. The x-axis also features a different date range (1959 to 2009). The populations of the seven countries (including the U.S.) are quite different. 10 percent of union membership in the U.S. is very different than 10 percent in Germany or Italy.

It feels like the charts in this piece were a bit of an afterthought. I would have appreciated seeing more consideration for the **color and type** of chart too. The two color pallettes that the author chose to use were pink/purple and blue. Three of the international charts are in shades of pink, and the other three are in shades of blue. I found this decision slightly misleading because it communicates some kind of relationship exists between the countries with similarly hued charts, whenn in reality, they are six distinct charts. 

I would have liked to see more **creativity** in the charts too. I think the concept could have been developed further before relying on charts to supplement the article. I think the core concept: union membership has declined, is a simple concept that doesn't necessarily require a visual. It is communicated well in the writing. But if there was additional data to provide more nuance to that picture, then the charts could have been considered. For instance, the author states: " Healthcare, restaurant, and hospitality jobs are among the fastest growing and, historically, these industries that have not had high unionization rate." Perhaps a chart showing the correlation between the growth rate of these industries and the decline in unions would have been interesting.

## Are corporations in violation of the WARN Act being held accountable?
The WARN Act (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act) requires that companies with over 75 full-time employees provide at least 60 days notice to workers before mass closures and layoffs. But workers often find themselves facing employers who violate the act. Late last year in Chicago, seven Treasure Island grocery stores closed and about 700 workers lost their jobs, accrued paid time off and health care benefits. They never got the severance pay that the WARN Act required. A group of workers filed a class action lawsuit, but it will be months before workers find out if they receive compensation, if any. How often are corporations in violation of the WARN Act held accountable, and how often do workers see their lost pay? I want to analyze federal WARN Act data to see how well the law is being enforced. 

### EXAMPLE OF ARTICLE USING DATA: ProPublica produced a series called [Insult to Injury](https://www.propublica.org/series/workers-compensation) about workers hurt on the job and left uncompensated due to the gutting of worker benefits across the country. One article in particular in the series titled, [The demolition of workers' comp](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-demolition-of-workers-compensation)stood out to me for its compelling presentation of data. One of the data visualizations in the article an [interactive component](https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/workers-comp-reform-by-state) that readers can link to for more detail that I will critique here. 

I would give the **clarity and accuracy** of the visualization a 4. The journalists were careful to provide both a title and dek to the data visualization to guide readers through complicated findings. The data presented is complex -- it shows worker compensation outcomes in each state, broken down by three categories (cuts to benefits, benefits staying the same, benefits increased). To visualize these shifts over time, the visualization assigns easily understandable colors (red represents loss, green an increase, and yellow minimal change). The data is also displayed in two different types of visualizations:

  1. The first visualization features small, color-coordinated circles, each representing a different state. The circles are organized in the shape of the United States and each circle has the state initials on it. Clicking on the state pulls up recent legislation that either cuts or adds worker compensation benefits
  1. Readers can also filter by their specific state to find this same information.

I think the quality is also noteworthy. The investigative journalists compiled their own system to rank each state by quality of workers compensation after going over court documents and insurance statements on their own. This information did not exist in this digestable form. The authors also decided to provide an explanation below as to how they analyzed the data. 
I would give **quality** a 5, but I will note that having the data presented in two different visualizations does present significant data that could be overwhelming for a reader. However, the fact that the team decided to link to this more in-depth interactive graphic outside the article (while still providing an abbreviated one in the article) I think solves this issue. As I mentioned above, I found the color coordination to be helpful too. I liked the subtle, gradations of the colors too to demonstrate the spectrum of legislation from most supportive of workers (green) to least supportive of workers (red).

I would rateHovering over state in circle form, or state in list form also outlines the content in black as it appears in the corresponding visualization. The graphics are also sophisticated in that the viewer can select the information they are most interested in. They can filter the information down by the following:
  1. STATE
  1. CUTS TO BENEFITS
  1. STAYED THE SAME
  1. RAISED BENEFITS
  1. VIEW ALL
  
**Creativity** I would give a 5. I think the journalists took a very complex set of information and distilled it into a very digestable format that readers can find a personal stake in (sort by state function). Another feature includes a box explaining the "historical standard" of the state change, that pops up when the viewer hovers a cursor over the state. This gives context to the change. Overall, the graphic is incredibly detailed and informative.
