## Assignment 5: Interview a dataset

[Link to the data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k0LqA02MsXWSc2QqRUn8T11Z7-qxdgCAYy7uA5piTBY/edit?usp=sharing)
*I did the analysis in Excel, but am providing the data here in Google Sheets for ease of access* 

Three questions I asked my dataset:
1. What nationality of immigrants face the highest rates for bond? 
2. What nationality of immigrants have the highest chance of receiving bond? 
3. Immigrants from which country had the most bond hearings last fiscal year?

Since TRAC does not have a "download feature," I analyzed the data using the tools that they provide on the [TRAC website](https://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/bond/). For my final project, I have been interviewing government officials, attorneys and activists working with immigrants from outside Central America (specifically India, Palestine and Haiti). One of my sources alerted me to the fact that TRAC recently requested and published data on bond amounts/outcomes for immigrants. I have learned that under the Trump administration, immigrants' chances of obtaining bond and parole have drastically decreased. But I still wanted to know the different outcomes happening to the groups of immigrants I am following. Nationality is not the only factor influencing one's chance of bond. Court hearing location and the judge have also been factors that could determine one's likelihood for receiving bond, and the amount of bond. 

First, I cleaned the data. It was fairly clean already, but I added "n/a" to cells where no data was collected or available. I also made two separate sheets to distinquish between 2018 and 2019.
Second, I sorted highest median bond rate to lowest bond rate, by country, and then lowest median bond rate to highest bond rate. I found that detained immigrants from India had the highest median bond rate in 2018 (at $17,000), and immigrants from the Phillipines had the lowest median bond rate at $4,000. None the less, the expectation that the majority of immigrants, especially those seeking asylum, can afford bond at any amount, is difficult to believe and worth examining further. 
Third, I sorted by highest percentage of bond granted by country, and then lowest percentage of bond granted by country. Immigrants from India in detention received bond 87 percent of the time. Immigrants from Cuba were offered bond only 11 percent of the time. 
Fourth, I sorted the number of bond hearings by country descending to ascending to see which country saw the highest count of bond court hearings. Immigrants from Mexico had the most bond court hearings last fiscal year, totaling 31,048.

## Headline: *Where you're from can determine your bond in immigration court*
## Nutgraf: Immigrants apprehended and held in detention centers by Immigration and Customs Enforcement remain imprisoned for as long as it takes for their case to make it through a backlogged immigration court system, that is unless a judge grants them bond. But the chance of obtaining bond, and the amount a judge sets a bond at, fluctuates dramatically depending on the nationality of the immigrant, according to records obtained and analyzed by TRAC. An immigrant from India has an 87 percent chance of obtaining bond in immigration court, while an immigrant from Cuba has only an 11 percent chance. The median bond amount granted to immigrants also ranges from $4,000 to $17,000, depending on one's country of origin.
