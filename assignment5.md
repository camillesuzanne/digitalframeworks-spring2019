## *still working on this* Assignment 5: Interview a dataset

[Link to the data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k0LqA02MsXWSc2QqRUn8T11Z7-qxdgCAYy7uA5piTBY/edit?usp=sharing)
*I did the analysis in Excel, but am providing the data here in Google Sheets for ease of access* 

Three questions I asked my dataset:
1. What nationality of immigrants face the highest rates for bond? 
2. What nationality of immigrants have the highest chance of receiving bond? 
3. Immigrants from which country had the most bond hearings last fiscal year?

Since TRAC does not have a "download feature," I analyzed the data using the tools that they provide on the [TRAC website](https://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/bond/). For my final project, I have been interviewing government officials, attorneys and activists working with immigrants from outside Central America (specifically India, Palestine and Haiti). One of my sources alerted me to the fact that TRAC recently requested and published data on bond amounts/outcomes for immigrants. I have learned that under the Trump administration, immigrants' chances of obtaining bond and parole have drastically decreased. But I still wanted to know the different outcomes happening to the groups of immigrants I am following. 

First, I cleaned the data. It was fairly clean already, but I added "n/a" to cells where no data was collected or available. I also made two separate sheets to distinquish between 2018 and 2019.
Second, I sorted highest median bond rate to lowest bond rate, by country, and then lowest median bond rate to highest bond rate. I found that detained immigrants from India had the highest median bond rate in 2018 (at $17,000), and immigrants from the Phillipines had the lowest median bond rate at $4,000. None the less, the expectation that the majority of immigrants, especially those seeking asylum, can afford bond at any amount, is difficult to believe and worth examining further. 
Third, I sorted by highest percentage of bond granted by country, and then lowest percentage of bond granted by country. Immigrants from India in detention received bond 87 percent of the time. Immigrants from Cuba were offered bond only 11 percent of the time. 
Fourth, I sorted the number of bond hearings by country descending to ascending to see which country saw the highest count of bond court hearings. Immigrants from Mexico had the most bond court hearings last fiscal year, totaling 31,048.
