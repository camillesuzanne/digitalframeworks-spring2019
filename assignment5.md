## *still working on this* Assignment 5: Interview a dataset

[Link to the data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k0LqA02MsXWSc2QqRUn8T11Z7-qxdgCAYy7uA5piTBY/edit?usp=sharing)

Three questions:
1. Immigrants from which countries face the highest rates for bond? 
2. Immigrants from which countries have the highest chance of receiving bond? 
3. Asldkja sldkajs lkasdj asd

Since TRAC does not have a "download feature," I analyzed the data using the tools that they provide on the [TRAC website](https://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/bond/). For my final project, I have been interviewing government officials, attorneys and activists working with immigrants from outside Central America (specifically India, Palestine and Haiti). One of my sources alerted me to the fact that TRAC recently requested and published data on bond amounts/outcomes for immigrants. I have learned that under the Trump administration, immigrants' chances of obtaining bond and parole have drastically decreased. But I still wanted to know the different outcomes happening to the groups of immigrants I am following. 

First, I cleaned the data. It was fairly clean already, but I added "n/a" to cells where no data was collected or available. I also made two separate sheets to distinquish between 2018 and 2019.
Second, I sorted highest median bond rate to lowest bond rate, by country, and then lowest median bond rate to highest bond rate. I found that TK had the highest median bond rate in 2018, and TK had the lowest median bond rate at. None the less, the expectations that immigrants, especially those seeking asylum, can afford bond, regardless of the price, is difficult to believe and worth examining further. 
Third, I sorted by highest percentage of bond granted by country, and then lowest percentage of bond granted by country.
