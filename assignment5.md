## Assignment 5: Interview a dataset

[Link to the data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k0LqA02MsXWSc2QqRUn8T11Z7-qxdgCAYy7uA5piTBY/edit?usp=sharing)

Three questions:
1. Immigrants from which countries face the highest rates for bond? 
2. Immigrants from which countries have the highest chance of receiving bond? 
3. Asldkja sldkajs lkasdj asd

Since TRAC does not have a "download feature," I analyzed the data using the tools that they provide on the [TRAC website](https://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/bond/). For my final project, I have been interviewing government officials, attorneys and activists working with immigrants from outside Central America (specifically India, Palestine and Haiti). One of my sources alerted me to the fact that TRAC recently requested and published data on bond amounts/outcomes for immigrants. I have learned that under the Trump administration, immigrants' chances of obtaining bond and parole have drastically decreased. But I still wanted to know the different outcomes happening to the groups of immigrants I am following. 

First, I cleaned the data. It was fairly clean already, but I added "n/a" to cells where no data was collected or available. 
Second, I sorted highest bond rate to lowest bond rate, by country, and then lowest bond rate to highest bond rate.
