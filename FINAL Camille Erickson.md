## As detention beds fill, immigration attorneys warn of uptick in religious discrimination 

By Camille Erickson 

Immigration agents began force-feeding nine asylum seekers on hunger strike through their noses at an El Paso detention center in January. 

Jasvir Singh and Rajandeep Singh were among them. 

The two men in their twenties both practice Sikhism and fled political persecution in the Punjab region of India to request asylum in the U.S. But upon arriving in 2018, they were detained and denied bond. 

Along with fellow detainees, they sustained a hunger strike for nearly 80 days in protest of the religious discrimination and psychological abuse endured in detention, according to [South Asian Americans Leading Together, an organization fighting for the release of immigrants in detention.](https://saalt.org/men-who-sustained-80-day-hunger-strike-released-from-el-paso-detention-facility/)

SAALT received reports from both Indian and Cuban asylum seekers imprisoned in the El Paso detention, detailing force-feeding along with solitary confinement and minimal religious accommodations.

“All of the men told me about how they were subjected to frequent racial and ethnic slurs while detained,” Nathan Craig, a volunteer, said in a statement. Craig was involved Advocate Visitors with Immigrants in Detention and met regularly with the detained asylum seekers on hunger strike.

As public pressure mounted, a federal judge ordered the two men released on bond in April. At least five of the other men who participated in the hunger strike were deported.

“There are no detainees on hunger strike in El Paso at this time,” a public affairs officer for ICE said in an emailed statement. She declined to answer more detailed questions. 

*Of the over 42,000 asylum cases decided last fiscal year, half involved immigrants from over 100 countries outside Central America, according to [Syracuse University's TRAC data](https://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/asylum/). Of all asylum cases completed in the 2018 fiscal year, 46 percent of the asylum-seeking immigrants were detained at some point in the process. As the number of immigrants from around the world apprehended and placed in custody [swells](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/sw-border-migration), reports of religious discrimination in detention have also persisted, according to multiple attorneys and immigrant rights organizations.*

“We see people from all over the world in detention,” said Liz Martinez, executive director of Freedom for Immigrants, an organization advocating for abolishing detention. “I think it's important to state, because people often think that [immigrants] are only coming from Central America.” 

On June 3, Immigration and Customs Enforcement [reported](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/border-patrol-agents-apprehend-group-37-africa) arresting a group of 37 undocumented immigrants from Central Africa at the border in Eagle Pass, Texas.

“We are continuing to see a rise in apprehensions of immigrants from countries not normally encountered in our area. Groups of family units from around the world are traveling thousands of miles just [sic] enter the United States illegally to exploit our immigration laws,” said Del Rio Sector Chief Patrol Agent Raul L. Ortiz in a statement. 

Immigrants in detention come from about 175 countries outside of Central America, according to the latest [TRAC data](https://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/detention/).

### A new norm: Indefinite detention 

Before the Trump administration, many asylum seekers who passed credible fear interviews were released on parole. But asylum seekers' ability to receive parole the past two years has sharply declined, leaving many to await their fate in detention, [according to a lawsuit](https://www.lexisnexis.com/legalnewsroom/immigration/b/insidenews/posts/aclu-of-la-and-splc-sue-trump-administration-for-illegally-denying-parole-to-asylum-seekers) filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against the Department of Homeland Security. 

“Under the prior administration, by and large those folks wouldn't have been locked up pending their case, because there's a recognition that it's really not in the public's interest to lock up asylum seekers who don't pose a threat to anybody and who are exercising their right to apply for status here in our country,” said Michael Tan, an attorney with the ACLU. 

About [58 percent](https://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/530/) of immigrants in detention have no criminal record, according to TRAC data. But judges denied bond in [38,271 cases](https://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/bond/) last fiscal year — a record high.

And it’s not only asylum seekers who have been stuck in detention. Undocumented immigrants apprehended and held in detention centers by ICE remain in jail for as long as it takes for their case to process in immigration court, unless a judge grants them bond. 

The average processing time for an immigration case hit an all-time high last year of [578 days](https://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/court_backlog/). As of April 2019, there is a backlog of [892,517 cases](https://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/court_backlog/) waiting to be processed in immigration court.

But in addition to the sharp decline in immigrants’ chance of obtaining bond, the amount a judge sets bond at fluctuates dramatically depending on the nationality of the immigrant, according to TRAC data. 

For example, an immigrant from India has an 87 percent chance of obtaining bond in immigration court, while an immigrant from Cuba has only an 11 percent chance. The median bond amount granted to immigrants also ranges from $4,000 to $17,000, depending on one's country of origin. Regardless, bond is often cost-prohibitive for immigrants, according to several immigration attorneys.

Being detained creates additional barriers for immigrants hoping to accessing representation in court too. 

"Asylum seekers are 10 times more likely to obtain relief when they have access to an attorney,” said Laura Lynch, senior policy council at the American Immigration Lawyers Association. 

What’s more, because immigrants arrive at detention speaking dozens of different languages, communication and cultural barriers are not uncommon and can lead to inadequate due process or abuse, Lynch said. 

“Being held in these conditions it's obviously traumatic and jeopardizes one's ability to effectively communicate with counsel,” Lynch said. 

Immigration courts often provide in-person translation for only Spanish speakers. The vast majority of other languages are interpreted via telephonic interpreters, or interpreters on the phone, according to a report by the [Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/reports/2019/02/20/466144/language-access-life-death-consequences-migrants/), a liberal advocacy and research organization.

“Historically, interpreters were present in the immigration courtroom proceeding, which is really important given communication barriers, not being able to read body language [or] accurately interpret what the respondent is testifying to,” Lynch added.

### A nightmare in Florida

Five Muslim refugees held in Glades County Detention Center, a private jail that contracts with ICE in Florida, reported nearly two dozen times that correctional staff were denying them proper religious accommodations, according to a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court of Florida in February. 

Muslim Advocates and Americans for Immigrant Justice, two organizations fighting for immigrant rights, filed the formal complaint on behalf of the men claiming they were “denied the ability to freely practice their faith while in detention.” 

“In the United States, people have the right to religious free exercise. Unless there's very good reason to stop people from practicing their sincere beliefs, they're allowed to,” said Yusuf Saei, a fellow for Muslim Advocates. “That applies in prison and that also applies in civil detention like immigration detention.”

According to the complaint, agents shackled the men for multiple days, denied them the ability to go to the bathroom, cancelled their prayer times, served non-halal meals and refused to give them religious attire, such as a kufis or prayer rugs. The men resorted to using towels or bedsheets as religious attire substitutes during prayer. Correctional staff also provided Qur’ans only in English too, according to court documents.

ICE did not return requests for comment. 

Upon entering Glades County Detention Center, the Muslim men reported not being asked about their religious needs. “Preferential treatment” was given to Christian attendees, according to the complaint. 

To the attorneys, this treatment had a damaging impact on each of the men’s emotional and physical well-being.

“The damage is very real,” Saei said. “It's the mental anguish of not being able to get any kind of spiritual respite or repose that you are used to getting when you're in prison or immigration detention.”

### Stateless and surveilled

Mohamed Emad lived in the U.S. for 25 years after coming to the country on a student visa in 1994. Emad was born in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia after his parents escaped violence in Palestine in 1948. Emad holds refugee status in Saudi Arabia but is technically considered stateless, [according to court documents.](https://www.macarthurjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/001-04-25-2019-Complaint-w.-Cover-Sheet.pdf) 

He worked at William Ho’s Chinese restaurant in Milwaukee and served as an active member of a nearby mosque. 

Despite having no criminal record, beginning in 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigations surveilled Emad for possible involvement with terrorist activity. In March 2018, law enforcement arrested, detained and denied Emad bond. 

Emad landed in Dodge County Jail in Wisconsin, a facility that contracts with ICE to detain immigrants. 

In April, the MacArthur Justice Center filed a complaint with the U.S. District Court of Wisconsin on Emad’s behalf for alleged violations of his constitutional rights while in detention, including obstructing his ability to practice his religious while indefinitely detained. According to the complaint, his arrest was based on false information and Emad “vehemently denies the allegations.”

Rey Wences, co-founder of Organized Communities Against Deportations, a grassroots organization led by immigrants, rallied activists and community members in support of Emad after he was unexpectedly detained. 

“Mohamed is a very well-known community member,” Wences, an immigrant herself, said. “People both in Milwaukee and in Chicago were coming out to support him.”

Correctional staff denied his medications and multiple requests for a proper place to pray. The correctional staff said there was no space available for him to pray, even though Christian detainees have a dedicated room for Bible study, according to court documents. “Emad is being denied the ability to freely exercise his religion — he is being denied access to a space for communal Friday Prayer and is forced to pray in his cell, just inches from his toilet,” his attorneys said.

To Saei of Muslim Advocates, denying immigrants in detention the ability to practice their religion has severe consequences. 

“It's a very serious harm [to one's] dignity,” Saei said. “I think that it's just one of the bad things that can happen to people in immigration detention that ICE and these detention facilities seem to have accepted as normal. But it's not normal.”
