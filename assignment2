# Assignment 2

## Description 

Cities across the country have yet to see the federal money they've been promised for more than two dozen infrastructure projects. Congress appropriated $2.3 billion to the Department of Transportation in fiscal years 2017 and 2018 for local governments' transit and infrastructure projects. But Federal Transit Authority issued only 23 percent of this allocated grant funding over the two year period, according to the Congressional Research Service.
 
This year, the Trump administration continues to withhold promised federal grants, stalling light rail, bus and rail improvements -- from Tempe, Arizona to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The funding drought has come at a cost for cities and states, forcing local governments to shoulder the costs of essential infrastructure projects, or cancel them.  I am investigating why the Federal Transit Authority is not distributing Capital Investment Grant Program funds, and what impact these delays have had on grant recipients in 17 states.

Under the Obama Administration, FTA published data documenting which grants had been obligated, or awarded, to each of these projects. However, this information is no longer available. Only annual estimates of grants that will be distributed are available. 

## Data Points

1. Project Name
1. Location
1. Amount
1. Date Money Awarded
1. Total Awarded 
1. Date Project Initated 
1. Type of Grant 
1. Project Description


## Method
After speaking with the organization Transportation for America, they suggested that one way to capture this information now is to look through news releases from FTA and elsewhere to record when each project actually received a grant. By sifting through news releases, this database will capture CIG grant allocations so I can determine how much has been awarded and how much remains in FTA's pockets.
